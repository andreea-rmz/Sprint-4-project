Project Sprint 4 

Project Description

For this project, you will work with data from Instacart.
Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can register an order and have it delivered, similar to Uber Eats and Door Dash. This particular data set was publicly released by Instacart in 2017 for a Kaggle competition. The actual data can be downloaded directly from the Kaggle competition page.
The data set we have provided you has modifications from the original. We reduced the set size to make your calculations faster and introduced missing and duplicate values. We were careful to preserve the distributions of the original data when we made the changes.
Your mission is to clean the data and prepare a report that provides insights into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. After answering each question, write a brief explanation of your results in a markdown cell in your Jupyter notebook.
